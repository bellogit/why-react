React is an open-source JavaScript library managed by **Facebook**. It focuses on individual components rather than the entire web app. This means that it allows developers to break down complex UI (app) into simpler components. This results in a much faster web app with minimum code.

React was developed to help improve the total rendered pages from the website server. Besides, *it utilizes nodes to render on the client-side*.

Let's look at the **why React**:

- It allows developers to write their apps within JavaScript. This is due to the feature React provides for developers. **JSX** (a **syntactical sugar**) is one common feature that allows custom **HTML** in JavaScript.

- It is a component-based framework. Write a component once and reuse it in JavaScript (**JSX**). These allow developers to focus on components instead of the entire web app. That is, developers can break down a complex UI into components for the best rendering performance.

- Props allow developers to pass custom data to a  UI component for a better manageable state. It only updates data that changes rather than the entire web app.

- The state makes it possible to store changes in one section. This makes debugging easier to fix because changeable contents are in a single location (state).

- It uses **Virtual DOM** for faster apps. Virtual DOM allows React to know when exactly to re-render or ignore specific pieces of DOM changes. This is crucial in enhancing the user experience.

- It is easy to learn.

- It has a large community of developers.

- Companies are in high demand for React developers. 

- It is **SEO-friendly**. [How Google works is that](https://moz.com/learn/seo/page-speed), the lower the page load time, and the faster the rendering speed, the higher an app ranking on Google. Thanks to the fast rendering, React, compared to other frameworks, significantly reduces the page load time, which greatly helps businesses in securing the first rank on Google Search Engine Result Page.

- React has native libraries. This means been conversant with React makes it easier to learn **React-native** to start creating mobile apps - **iPhone Operating System** (**IOS**), Android, etc.

> React-native is the building of a mobile app framework. It uses the same design as React.

The insight [Stackoverflow Survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-web-frameworks-wanted2) shows that React is the most wanted framework.

**Happy Coding!!!**
